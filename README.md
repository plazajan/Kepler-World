Kepler's World

A simple simulation of movements of planets around the Sun.
Uses a discrete approximation of the real-world continuous
application of Newton's law of gravity (F=GMm/(rr).
The calculations are done for actual planets,
and results are later scaled down to be displayed in turtle graphics.
The simulation tests if the resulting orbits and planets' movements conform
to the Kepler laws, and to their enhancements, such as the Vis Viva Equation.
This provides an example of continuing local effect (of the law of gravity),
having a global effect (of elliptical orbits with details specified by Kepler.)
