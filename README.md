Kepler's World

A simple simulation of movements of planets around the Sun.
It uses a discrete approximation of the real-world continuous effect
of the Newton's law of gravity (F = GMm/(r^2) on the moving planet.

The calculations are done for actual planets,
and the results are scaled down to be displayed in turtle graphics.

The simulation tests if the resulting orbits and planets' movements
obey the Kepler laws.

The simulation shows planets' orbits to scale, 
but disregards some details not relevant to Kepler's laws.
Namely, in this simulation (unlike in reality):
* the orbits of all planets are in the same plane, and
* the foci of elliptical orbits of all planets are on the same straight line.
* the period in which the turtle completes the orbit is proportional to the
  actual orbital period of the planet, but the scaling factor is not the same
  as for orbit's size.

Methodology of science concepts:
* areas of science: experimental/observational, theoretical, computational.
* discrete simulation of a continuous process.
* qualitative vs. quantitative statements
  (a planet moves fastest when close to the Sun vs. Kepler's 2nd law).
* local effects (of the law of gravity) vs.
  global properties (elliptical orbits with details specified by Kepler).
