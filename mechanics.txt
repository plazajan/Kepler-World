Ellipse

Every ellipse on a given plane
can be defined by specifying two points f1, f2, called foci,
and a constant d greater than or equal to dist(f1, f2).
A point p in the plane belong to the ellipse iff
dist(f1,p) + dist(f2,p) = d.

Parameters:

Consider an ellipse with the foci at (-f,0) and (f,0)
on a Cartesian plane, where f>=0.

Such an ellipse has a center at (0,0) and
is symmetric with respect to:
    point symmetry with respect to (0,0),
    reflection with respect to the x-axis,
    reflection with respect to the y-axis.

left vertex, right vertex - the points where the ellipse intersects the x-axis.
lower vertex, upper vertex - the points where the ellipse intersects the y-axis.

a - semi-major axis - the distance from the center to the right (or left) vertex.
b - semi-minor axis - the distance from the center to the upper (or lower) vertex.
c - linar eccentricity - the distance from the center to a focus.
A - aphelion - the bigger of the distances from the foci to the right vertex.
P - perihelion - the smaller of the distances from the foci to the right vertex.
e - eccentricity = c/a.

2c + 2(a-c) = 2 sqrt(b^2 + c^2) -- from Pythagorean equation.
So, 2a = 2 sqrt(b^2 + c^2)
So, a = sqrt(b^2 + c^2)
So, a^2 = b^2 + c^2

P = a-c

A = a+c

a = (A+P)/2

c = a-P = (A+P)/2 - P = (A-P)/2

b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = ((A+P)/2)^2 - ((A-P)/2)^2 = 4AP/4 = AP
So, b = sqrt(AP)

e = c/a = sqrt(a^2-b^2) / a = sqrt(1- (b^2)/(a^2))
So, c = ae = sqrt(a^2-b^2)

Alternatively, an ellipse with major axis 2a on the x-axis of a Cartesian plane,
can be obtained by taking a circle with diameter 2a on the x-axis,
and contracting the plane in (only) the y direction by some constant factor.

A parametric equation of a circle with radius r and the center at (0,0):
x = r cos t,
y = r sin t,
where t in [0, 2pi).

A parametric equation of elipse with semi-major axis a and semi-minor axis b
and the center at (0,0):
x = a cos t,
y = b sin t,
where t in [0, 2pi).

Exercise

and the center at (-c,0), where a,b,c are given.

Exercise

and the center at (f2,0), where f2 is the right focus, 
everything calculated from a, b.

Vectors and matrices in R^2.

Adding vectors: ...

Length/magnitude of a vector: |(x,y)| = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

A unit vector in the direction of vector (x,y):

v = |v|*u, where u is the unit vector in the direction of v

2x2 matrix
    a b
    c d

Determinant of this matrix: det M = ad - bc

Area of a parallelogram spanned by two vectors =
= the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix with such column vectors.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Newtonian mechanics, laws of motion

A body not subject to forces is at rest or moves straight at a constant speed.

F = ma

Law of gravity: F = G Mm / (r^2)

Velocity is a vector (vx,vy) - may vary with time
vx - horizontal speed, vy - vertical speed

speed is a scalar - the length/magnitude of velocity

Acceleration is a vector (ax, ay)
(ax, ay)- horizontal and vertical acceleration.
For a body moving on a straight line, (vx,vy) and (ax,ay) are parallel.
For a body moving on a circular orbit, (vx,vy) and (ax,ay) are perpendicular.
For a body moving on a curve, (vx,vy) and (ax,ay) are not parallel.

Change of position after time dt
dx += vx * dt
dy += vy * dt

Change of velocity after time dt
dvx += ax * dt
dvy += ay * dt

Acceleration of m orbiting stationary M while at distance r.
ax = -G*M*x/(r^3) 
ay = -G*M*y/(r^3)

Centripetal force - the force that makes the body to follow a curved path
F = ma = mv^2/r

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Planetary motion (celestial mechanics)

The two-body problem parameters (.

G - the gravitational constant = 6.67430e-11 # m^3 / (kg * s^2).

M - the bigger mass (Sun, considered stationary)
m - the smaller mass (planet, given some initial velocity, subject to Ms gravity.)

mu - gravitational parameter = G(M+m)
approximately GM when m << M.

r - the distance between M and m (varies with time)
v - speed of m at its orbit around stationary M (varies with time)

T - orbital period of m in the movement around M.
a - semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit of m around M.

------

Keplers 1st law:

    the planet moves on an elliptical orbit with the Sun in one focus.

Keplers 2nd law: the planet moves at such a speed that:
        
    The line connecting the Sun and the planet
    sweeps equal areas in equal periods of time,

    The area of the parallelogram spanned by vectors r and v is constant

    The determinant of the square matrix with columns r and v is constant.
    
    Vis Viva Equation: v^2 = G(M+m)(2/r - 1/a)

------

Keplers 3rd law:

    T^2 / a^3 = const
    
    If orbital period in years, and semi-major axis in AU (astronomical units):
    P^2 = a^3

    T^2 / a^3 = 4 pi^2 / (G(M+m)) 
    i.e. T = 2 pi sqrt(a^3 / (G(M+m) )
    (If using G in m^3 / (kg * s^2), make sure to use m,s,kg everywhere.)
    
In the case of circular orbits this can be easily derived from:
F = mv^2/r (centripetal)
F = GMm/(r^2) (gravitational)

We can verify T^2 = a^3 for Mars:
Mars' sami major axis = 1.524 AU, so its orbital is
T = sqrt(1.524^3) = 1.88 years

Celestial Mechanics calculations

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The maximum speed of a planet (at the perihelion)

v^2 = G(M+m)(2/r - 1/a)
so, 
vmax = G(M+m)(2/P - 1/a) where P = perihelion distance

solve for a:
a = PG(M+m) / (2G(M+m)-P*v^2)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mass of the Sun
from the Earth-Sun distance and Earth's orbital period

T^2 / a^3 = 4 pi^2 / (GM) because M>>m (mass of Sun >> mass of Earth)
T - Earth's orbital period
a - Earth's semi-major axis ~ distance to Sun
T, a are observable.
From the equation, one can calculate the mass of the Sun.
