ACTIVITIES

up to 1 hour - ASTRONOMY: concepts of ecliptic, perihelion, aphelion, 
               Kepler laws, vis-viva equation and orbital period equations
               -- these are covered by the slideshow StarrySky.pdf
               together with the history of early discoveries.
               COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENT: running Kepler's World.
               
up to 1 hour - MATHEMATICS: ellipse equation, locus of equal sums from foci, 
               parameters of an ellipse,
               calculating ... from ...
               
up to 1 hour - PHYSICS: adding velocities as vectors, Newton's 2nd law F=ma.

up to 1 hour - PHYSICS/MATHEMATICS (optional, for more advanced students,
               but without using calculus): derivation of vis viva equation:
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation

up to 1 hour - PROGRAMMING (optional): code walk through of Kepler's World.
               
up to 1 hour - PROGRAMMING (optional): students modify the code of Kepler's 
               World
               a) include Pluto and/or Halley's comet
               b) Simulate an orbit under an (incorrect) variant of the law of
                  universal gravitation F = G(M+m)/r, 
                  where the exponent at r is 1 instead of 2.
                  Then, make the exponent 3.
               
up to 2 hours - METHODOLOGY OF SCIENCE.

Note: for more advanced students familiar with calculus, the instructor can 
      provide mathematical derivation of Kepler's laws from Newton's laws.
